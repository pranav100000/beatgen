# App Flow Document

## Introduction

This online Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) is built with React and enhanced with AI features to support hobbyists in creating and managing digital audio projects. The DAW lets users upload audio files, add MIDI tracks, and leverage AI to generate MIDI compositions and sounds. The application is designed to be intuitive and straightforward, ensuring that users can dive straight into music creation with minimal fuss. With essential features like an undo/redo action history and plans to improve the audio engine using Tone.js, the app is built on a reliable foundation that addresses the current challenges with playback and cursor control.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user visits the DAW, they are greeted by a simple, welcoming landing page that explains the purpose of the platform and prompts them to either sign up or log in. New users can register by providing an email address and setting a password. The registration process is streamlined, and there are also options to sign in using social logins if those become available in the future. For existing users, the login screen allows for quick authentication. If a user forgets their password, they have the option to recover it through a password recovery mechanism that guides them step-by-step. Once the appropriate credentials are entered, the user is seamlessly redirected to their personalized project dashboard.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After authenticating, the user lands on their main dashboard. The dashboard provides an overview of existing projects and includes options to create a new project. The interface features a clean design with clear navigation elements such as a header for global actions and a sidebar or menu that lists key areas of the app like project list, account settings, and collaboration options. The dashboard not only displays saved sessions and recent activity but also offers prominent calls-to-action for starting new sessions or uploading files. The layout ensures that users can quickly get into editing or manage their ongoing projects without additional navigational complexity.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

Within the project workspace, users begin their creative journey by creating a new project or selecting an existing one from the dashboard. Once in the workspace, the first critical action is uploading an audio file. The upload functionality is immediately available and, upon a successful upload, automatically creates a new track on the timeline. This action is logged by the history manager to allow for undo and redo functions throughout the session. In addition to audio file uploads, the workspace also provides the option to initiate MIDI track creation. When a user decides to generate a MIDI track, they trigger a request to the backend AI service. The application sends the necessary parameters, and once the AI-generated MIDI and sounds are returned, they are seamlessly integrated into the current session on a new track. The timeline is central to all activities here, and users interact with it to manage the sequencing of audio and MIDI tracks. Navigation within the workspace is made simple, with intuitive controls to move between uploading, editing, and integrating AI content. As users build up layers, the history manager is continuously tracking actions so that any missteps can quickly be undone or redone without losing progress.

## Settings and Account Management

Users can access account settings from any page via a dedicated area in the navigation menu. In the settings section, users manage their personal information, update preferences, and configure notifications related to project activity. If users need to adjust their billing details or manage subscriptions (if these features are later expanded), they will find straightforward interfaces to do so. This page also allows users to handle collaboration features, like sharing projects or inviting others to work on a session. Once changes are saved, users can easily return to their project dashboard or the project workspace. The transitions from settings back to the main application ensure that work is not disrupted and that users maintain their current context despite changes in configuration.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

In cases where users attempt actions with invalid data, such as entering an incorrect password during login or submitting a file in an unsupported format, the app promptly displays clear and friendly error messages. These messages explain the issue in simple terms and provide guidance on how to correct the input. During the process of uploading files or requesting AI-generated MIDI tracks, if the app encounters connectivity issues or backend errors, the user is shown an error page with options to retry the action. The app is designed so that these alternate paths and error states are handled gracefully, ensuring that users never feel lost and can always find their way back to the main flow. The error handling mechanisms are integrated across both the audio engineâ€™s functions and user actions such as file uploads or account modifications.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the moment a user signs up on the landing page to the dynamic creation and manipulation of audio tracks in the project workspace, the application is designed to make music production accessible and enjoyable. The journey starts with simple account creation and moves seamlessly into a rich, interactive environment where uploading audio, managing tracks, and integrating AI-generated MIDI happen in an organized and intuitive flow. Settings and account management features ensure that users can personalize their experience, while robust error handling guarantees recovery from any hiccups. With clearly defined page transitions and a focus on real-time performance through Tone.js, this DAW provides hobbyists with a complete ecosystem for creative exploration and efficient project management.
