# Tech Stack Document

## Introduction

This document explains the technology choices behind our online Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) application. The project is built using a modern combination of tools designed to provide an intuitive and enjoyable experience for hobbyists. Beyond basic audio file uploads and track creation, our application includes AI-generated MIDI support and precise audio playback features. With usability, scalability, and reliability in mind, the choices described here support seamless audio and MIDI synchronization while allowing for future enhancements.

## Frontend Technologies

The user interface of the DAW is built using React, a popular JavaScript library that focuses on creating dynamic, reactive web applications. React helps us build a clear component-based structure, which makes it easier for users to interact with the app without dealing with technical complexities. For audio playback and MIDI handling, we have integrated Tone.js, a specialized library that helps in creating real-time audio tasks. By choosing these technologies, we ensure that users have a responsive interface and enjoy a smooth workflow from uploading audio files to integrating AI-assisted MIDI tracks.

## Backend Technologies

On the server side, our application uses Node.js to handle the logic and communication between different parts of the system. Node.js allows us to set up a robust API, which processes user requests, manages project data, and triggers AI functionalities for MIDI generation. To store user projects, data, and other relevant information, MongoDB is used as our database. It is a flexible and scalable solution that handles data persistence efficiently. User authentication and session management are secured using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), ensuring that access to projects and sensitive interactions remains safe and reliable.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

The infrastructure supporting our DAW is designed to ensure stability and ease of deployment. We leverage modern hosting platforms that allow for rapid scaling, ensuring that our application remains responsive even as more users join. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are implemented to streamline updates and maintain version control, which are crucial for a consistent and bug-free experience. The choice of these tools not only improves the reliability of the application but also supports a seamless deployment process as new features are added over time.

## Third-Party Integrations

Our DAW integrates several third-party services to enrich its features and overall functionality. Tone.js, for instance, is a dedicated library that powers our audio playback and MIDI sequencing capabilities, ensuring minimal latency and precise timing. Additionally, user interactions related to project management and authentication are enhanced by trusted external libraries and services. These integrations allow the application to leverage advanced features without reinventing the wheel, creating a balanced ecosystem that supports both the creative process and user security.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Security in our tech stack is taken very seriously. By utilizing JWT for authentication, the application ensures that only authorized users have access to their projects and sensitive tools. MongoDB is set up with robust access controls to protect user data from unauthorized access. On the performance side, special attention is given to minimize latency during audio playback. The use of Tone.js helps manage real-time sequencing and ensures that both audio files and AI-generated MIDI tracks play in a synchronized manner for a smooth, lag-free experience. The architecture is designed to scale and perform efficiently even when handling several simultaneous operations, thus providing a reliable user experience.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

In summary, our online DAW leverages a carefully selected combination of technologies that work together to provide a user-friendly, scalable, and secure platform. By using React for the frontend, Tone.js for audio handling, Node.js and MongoDB for the backend, along with JWT for secure communication, we build a system that meets the needs of hobbyists and supports the integration of cutting-edge AI features. The integration of third-party tools and the streamlined deployment process further reinforces the systemâ€™s robustness. Ultimately, these choices not only address immediate challenges such as audio synchronization and security but also lay the foundation for future enhancements and scalability.
