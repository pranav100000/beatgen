The melody you create needs to be {duration_bars} bars long and needs to be in the key of {key} {mode} at {tempo} BPM.

Your task is to create a melody using INTERVALS (semitones) from the LAST NOTE (not the root note) rather than absolute pitches. Try to make the melody as catchy as possible by following repeated rhythmic patterns. This melody will be played in a loop, so it should sound good when played repeatedly. It is crucial to follow a structured rhythmic pattern for this reason. Try to follow a similar rhythmic pattern in each bar or pair of bars.
You will structure your output into {duration_bars} bars, each with their own musical intention. IMPORTANT: Make sure the end of your response is the JSON object WITH THE JSON TAG.

Musical Considerations:
- Mood: {mood if mood else "Not specified"}
- Tempo character: {tempo_character if tempo_character else "Not specified"}
- Rhythm type: {rhythm_type if rhythm_type else "Not specified"}
- Musical style: {musical_style if musical_style else "Not specified"}
- Melodic character: {melodic_character if melodic_character else "Not specified"}
- Chord progression: {chord_progression if chord_progression else "Not specified"}
IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT try to add contrast to the mood, tempo, rhythm, or melodic character. Just follow the description. Create a melody that follows the description as closely as possible.

Here are some tips to help create a catchy melody:
- Simplicity - Catchy melodies are usually simple enough to remember but not so simple that they're boring. They often use step-wise motion (moving to adjacent notes) with occasional leaps for interest.
- Repetition - Effective melodies contain repeated motifs or phrases that help listeners anticipate and remember the tune.
- Distinctive rhythm - A memorable rhythm pattern can make even a simple melodic line stand out.
- "Hook" element - Most catchy melodies contain a distinctive musical phrase or "hook" that captures attention and stays in memory.
- Balance between predictability and surprise - Great melodies follow expected patterns but include unexpected elements like unusual intervals or rhythmic variations that create interest.
- Emotional resonance - Melodies that evoke strong emotions tend to be more memorable.
- Singability - If a melody falls within a comfortable vocal range and is easy to sing, people are more likely to remember it.
- Strategic use of tension and resolution - Building tension through dissonance and then resolving it creates satisfaction for listeners.
- Effective use of contour - The shape of a melody as it rises and falls can create a sense of movement that pulls listeners along.
- Alignment with natural speech patterns - Melodies that follow natural speech inflections often feel more intuitive and memorable.
- DO NOT create a melody with a rhythm that is not repetitive at all. It should have a strong rhythmic pattern.
- DO NOT create a melody that is meant to be played once. The melody should be designed to be played in a loop. Therefore for the end of the melody, focus on repeatability and cohesiveness with the start of the melody rather than finality or resolution.

INTERVAL GUIDE - Emotional characteristics and usage:

ASCENDING INTERVALS:
- Unison (0): Stability, reinforcement, emphasis
- +1 (Minor Second): Tension, dissonance, chromatic movement, anxiety
- +2 (Major Second): Gentle forward motion, common stepwise movement
- +3 (Minor Third): Melancholy, sadness, introspection, bluesy feel
- +4 (Major Third): Brightness, happiness, uplift, triumphant feel
- +5 (Perfect Fourth): Strong, open sounds, ancient/modal feel
- +6 (Tritone): Maximum tension, dramatic effect, instability
- +7 (Perfect Fifth): Strong consonance, stability, power
- +8 (Minor Sixth): Bittersweet, nostalgic, emotional depth
- +9 (Major Sixth): Warmth, openness, optimism
- +10 (Minor Seventh): Bluesy, soulful, jazzy, creates expectation
- +11 (Major Seventh): Sophisticated, complex, dreamy, contemplative
- +12 (Octave): Stability, finality, dramatic range expansion

DESCENDING INTERVALS:
- -1 (Minor Second): Tension resolution, grief, sighing effect
- -2 (Major Second): Relaxation, conclusion, natural descent
- -3 (Minor Third): Melancholy, wistfulness, yielding
- -4 (Major Third): Brightness with conclusion, completeness
- -5 (Perfect Fourth): Strong cadential movement, grounding
- -6 (Tritone): Dramatic, unsettling, mysterious
- -7 (Perfect Fifth): Strong harmonic movement, conclusive
- -8 (Minor Sixth): Emotional, expressive, longing
- -9 (Major Sixth): Lyrical, expansive, nobility
- -10 (Minor Seventh): Bluesy, contemplative, emotional depth
- -11 (Major Seventh): Unusual, dramatic, complex
- -12 (Octave): Conclusion, finality, powerful grounding

IMPORTANT:
- Use only intervals that are appropriate for {key}
- Keep the total duration at {duration_beats} beats
- Choose intervals that evoke the requested mood and character
- IMPORTANT: YOU MUST choose notes that follow the chord progression: {chord_progression} as closely as possible. 
- Mix smaller intervals (for smooth motion) with larger intervals (for drama)
- Track the CUMULATIVE SUM of your intervals to ensure the melody stays within a singable range
- Track the CUMULATIVE SUM of your intervals to ensure it is ALWAYS one of these values: {allowed_intervals_string}. If the cumulative sum is not in this range, at any point, that means the note that caused that cumulative sum is out of key and it must be changed.
- Don't let the cumulative sum go below -7 or above +7 (relative to starting position)
- Plan your intervals to create a natural melodic arc with a climax and resolution
- DO NOT create a melody with a rhythm that is not repetitive at all. It should have a strong rhythmic pattern.

IMPORTANT:
- You must choose notes that follow the chord progression: {chord_progression} as closely as possible.
- You must use a repetitive rhythmic pattern.

Respond at the end of your response with a JSON object containing (IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU INCLUDE THE JSON TAG):
- "starting_octave": The octave to start on (3-5)
- "bars": Array of dicts with keys "bar_number", "notes"
    - "bar_number": The bar number associated with this bar of the melody (1-{duration_bars})
    - "musical_intention": The musical intention for this bar of the melody
    - "notes": Array of dicts with keys "interval", "duration", "velocity"
        - "interval": The semitone difference FROM THE PREVIOUS NOTE (or root note if it's the first note) (e.g., [0, +1, -2, +3]) OR "R" for a rest in STRING FORMAT, where:
        * "R" means a rest
        * "0" means stay on same note
        * "+1" means move up one semitone from the previous note
        * "-1" means move down one semitone from the previous note
        * Values like "+2", "+3", "-2", "-3" represent larger jumps from the previous note
        * IMPORTANT: These are RELATIVE semitone intervals from note to note, not scale degrees
        - "duration": Array of note durations as strings (e.g., ["sixteenth, "eighth", "quarter", "eighth triplet", "quarter triplet", "half", "dotted quarter", "dotted eighth", "dotted sixteenth", etc])
        * IMPORTANT: If you use a triplet, make sure the next two notes are also triplets
        - "velocity": Note velocity or volume (1-127).
        - "explanation": A short explanation of why you picked these values for this interval
        - "cumulative_sum": The cumulative sum of the intervals (should be between -7 and +7)
        - "cumulative_duration": The cumulative duration of the notes' durations. (e.g. cumulative_duration of sixteenth, eighth, eighth is 1/16 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4)
        - "is_in_key": Whether the cumulative sum is in these cumulative intervals: {allowed_intervals_string}. THIS SHOULD ALWAYS BE TRUE.
